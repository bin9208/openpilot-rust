# Source provenance and third-party notices

The torqued estimator preserves `openpilot/selfdrive/locationd/torqued.py` and
`helpers.py` behavior; the repository's original MIT license applies.

The MT19937 scalar seeding, tempering and shuffle interval algorithm in
`src/random.rs`, interpolation search in `src/interpolation.rs`, and pairwise
summation order in `src/numerics.rs` follow NumPy v2.4.6:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/v2.4.6/numpy/random
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v2.4.6/numpy/_core/src/multiarray/compiled_base.c
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v2.4.6/numpy/_core/src/umath/loops_utils.h.src

The copied algorithm provenance above remains NumPy v2.4.6; current compatibility
checks and native staging use the source-locked NumPy v2.5.3 with unchanged
sampling and numerical tolerances.

Native OpenBLAS/Fortran libraries are external build artifacts, never vendored
or imported from Python by the Rust daemon. `stage_torque_numerics.py` retains
the wheel's full license directory and archive/library SHA256 provenance.
Distributions must carry those staged license files along with this notice.
